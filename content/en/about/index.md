middle.

Unmanned aerial vehicle models have been developed and adapted in the context of constant monitoring of international experience and constant search for new ideas and techniques in the field of unmanned technologies.

In the agricultural sector, UAV are adapted to obtain the following information:

- Accurate inventory and records of land, regardless of whether they are cultivated or not
- Topographic data that can be obtained to support land development. Allows you to create a map of slopes and calculate the directions of landslides or runoff 9
- Digital terrain model together with elevation map can be used for: vertical
planning; flood simulations; sowing planning; drawing hydrological maps, etc.
- Using multispectral cameras and data processed by
specialized software, it is possible to obtain vegetation index maps (NDVI) for the assessment of plant development and based on the received maps, assessment of nutritional needs and assessment of plant exposure to stress.
